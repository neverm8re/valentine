Valentine Button Website

This website is designed for a romantic proposal to be a valentine. It features two buttons: "Yes" and "No," but the "No" button runs away from the user's cursor, creating a fun interactive effect.

📌 Features

The "No" button moves away from the cursor or touch input on mobile devices.

The "Yes" button remains available for selection.

The design is styled romantically with a dark red background and hearts.
